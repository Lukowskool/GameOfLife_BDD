Evolution of an alive cell

    An alive cell should follow the rules of the game
    when evolving from a generation to the next

    Scenario : A living cell with 0 neighbors
    given the following setup:

    | . || . || . |
    | . || X || . |
    | . || . || . |

    When I tell the cell to evolve once
    then the center cell should be dead

    Scenario : A living cell with 1 neighbor
    given the following setup:

    | . || . || . |
    | X || X || . |
    | . || . || . |

    When I tell the cell to evolve once
    then the center cell should be dead

    Scenario : A living cell with 2 neighbors
    given the following setup:

    | . || X || . |
    | X || X || . |
    | . || . || . |

    When I tell the cell to evolve once
    then the center cell should be alive

    Scenario : A living cell with 3 neighbors
    given the following setup:

    | . || X || . |
    | X || X || X |
    | . || . || . |

    When I tell the cell to evolve once
    then the center cell should be alive

    Scenario : A living cell with 4 neighbors
    given the following setup:

    | . || X || . |
    | . || X || X |
    | . || X || X |

    When I tell the cell to evolve once
    then the center cell should be dead

    Scenario : A living cell with 5 neighbors
    given the following setup:

    | . || X || . |
    | . || X || X |
    | X || X || X |

    When I tell the cell to evolve once
    then the center cell should be dead

    Scenario : A living cell with 6 neighbors
    given the following setup:

    | X || X || . |
    | . || X || X |
    | X || X || X |

    When I tell the cell to evolve once
    then the center cell should be dead

    Scenario : A living cell with 7 neighbors
    given the following setup:

    | X || X || . |
    | X || X || X |
    | X || X || X |

    When I tell the cell to evolve once
    then the center cell should be dead

    Scenario : A living cell with 8 neighbors
    given the following setup:

    | X || X || X |
    | X || X || X |
    | X || X || X |

    When I tell the cell to evolve once
    then the center cell should be dead
