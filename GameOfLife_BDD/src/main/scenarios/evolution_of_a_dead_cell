    A dead cell should follow the rules of the game

    Scenario: A dead cell with 0 neighbors stays dead
    Given the following setup :

    | . || . || . |
    | . || . || . |

    When I tell the cell to evolve once
    then the center cell should be dead

    Scenario: A dead cell with 1 neighbor stays dead
    Given the following setup :

    | . || . || . |
    | . || . || . |
    | . || . || . |

    | X || . || . |
    | . || . || . |

    When I tell the cell to evolve once
    then the center cell should be dead

    Scenario: A dead cell with 3 neighbors comes to life
    Given the following setup :

    | . || X || X |
    | X || . || . |
    | . || . || . |

    When I tell the cell to evolve once
    then the center cell should become alive

    Scenario: A dead cell with 4 neighbors stays dead
    Given the following setup :

    | X || X || X |
    | X || . || . |
    | . || . || . |

    When I tell the cell to evolve once
    then the center cell should be dead
